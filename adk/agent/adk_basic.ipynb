However, some projections indicate a potential slowdown to 2.3% in 2025, suggesting a possible recessionary trajectory driven by trade tensions and uncertainty [5]. The World Bank notes that the global economy seems to be settling at a low growth rate that may not be sufficient for sustained development [3]. Growth rates vary across regions, with a slight acceleration expected in advanced economies and a modest slowdown in emerging market and developing economies [1].\\n*   **Inflation:** Global inflation is expected to continue declining from 2023 levels, with forecasts around 5.8% to 5.9% in 2024 and further decreases to around 4.4% to 4.5% in 2025 [1].
